I want to create a brain MRI classification project similar to my X-ray disease classification project. 

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Classify brain MRI images into categories: Normal, Brain Tumor, Stroke (adjust based on your dataset)
2. Use the same structure and functionality as the X-ray project
3. Cover the same syllabus units (I, III, V, VI)
4. Include Streamlit app with all navigation pages:
   - Predict Condition
   - Dataset Overview
   - Dataset Preprocessing
   - Regression Models
   - Classification Models
   - Model Comparison
   - Model Information
   - Evaluation Metrics
5. Include regression models, classification models, and model comparison with graphs
6. Include dataset overview, preprocessing visualizations, and evaluation metrics

MY DATASET STRUCTURE:
- train_images/ folder with MRI images
- test_images/ folder with MRI images  
- labels_train.csv with file_name and class_id columns

CLASSES:
- 0: Normal
- 1: Brain Tumor
- 2: Stroke
(Adjust based on your dataset)

KEY CHANGES NEEDED:
1. Replace all "X-ray" references with "Brain MRI"
2. Replace "disease" with "condition" where appropriate
3. Update class names from ['Normal', 'Pneumonia', 'COVID-19'] to ['Normal', 'Brain Tumor', 'Stroke']
4. Update app headers from "X-ray Disease Classification" to "Brain MRI Classification"
5. Update file uploader text from "X-ray image" to "brain MRI image"
6. Update IMG_SIZE if needed (256 is common for MRI, or keep 224)
7. Handle grayscale MRI images (convert to RGB if needed)
8. Update all documentation and descriptions
9. Update README.md with brain MRI project information
10. Keep all functionality, graphs, visualizations, and syllabus coverage the same

FILES TO UPDATE:
- train_model.py: Update CLASS_NAMES, print statements, image preprocessing
- app.py: Update all headers, titles, descriptions, class names
- README.md: Update title, description, dataset info, class labels
- check_dataset.py: Update print statements
- predict_example.py: Update function names and descriptions
- SYLLABUS_MAPPING.md: Update examples to mention MRI

Please adapt all the code from the X-ray project to work with brain MRI images, maintaining:
- Same project structure
- Same functionality and features
- Same graphs and visualizations
- Same syllabus coverage
- Same evaluation metrics
- Same navigation structure

Only change the medical imaging context from X-ray to Brain MRI.
